# Distance

In small study regions, we can use <i>Euclidean Distance<\i>, which can be calculated using Pythagorasâ€™s formula:

$d_{ij} = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}$

Visual proof:

![](pyth_theorem.png)

Let's set up some data, using x-y coordinates for each point:
```{r}
A <- c(40, 43)
B <- c(1, 101)
C <- c(54, 111)
D <- c(104, 65)
E <- c(60, 22)
F <- c(20, 2)
pts <- rbind(A,B,C,D,E,F)
pts

```


Plot the points and labels:
```{r, points}
# plot(pts, xlim=c(0,120), ylim=c(0,120), pch=20, cex=2, col='red', xlab='X', ylab='Y', las=1)
# text(pts+5, LETTERS[1:6])

pts.df <- as.data.frame(pts)
names(pts.df) <- c("x", "y")

ggplot(data = pts.df) + 
  aes(x, y) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(label = rownames(pts.df))
```


What's the distance between A and B?
```{r}
A
B
```


Let's turn it into a function that will fund the distance between two coordinates:
```{r}
# distance function
euc_distance <- function (c1, c2) {
  sqrt(mean((c2- c1) ^ 2))
}

#test it
euc_distance(A, B)

#works on larger dimensions
euc_distance(c(3,1,8), c(7,9,2))

```


For our purposes, it will be useful to calculated a distance matrix. That is, a matrix that classifies the distance from every point to every other point. 


Let $\overrightarrow{c} = {c_1, c_2, ..., c_n}$.

Let $d_{ij}$ be the distance between points $i$ and $j$. Then

\[
D = \begin{bmatrix} 
    d_{11} & d_{12}  & \dots & d_{1n}\\
    d_{21} & d_{22}  & \dots & d_{1n}\\
    \vdots &  \vdots & \ddots & \\
    d_{n1} & d_{n2}  &        &da_{nn} 
    \end{bmatrix}
\]



How would we write a function for this?
```{r}





```



Or, we can use the built in function:
```{r}
#?dist
d <- dist(pts)
d
```

Why does it look like this?
```{r}
D = as.matrix(d)
D

```


# Spatial influence
-Much of spatial analysis seeks to answer the question, or control for, how much one point "influences" another. 
-To model this, we need to think about the relationship between points, and there are some common methods.


## Adjacency

### Distance Adjacency Matrix

To make a distance adjacenty matrix, we set a threshold. Say we want to find other points that are within a distance of 50 from each other. 

```{r}
a <-  D < 50
a
```

It can be useful to have this matrix in terms of ones and zeros, with value `NA` along the diagonal. 

```{r}
diag(a) <- NA
adj50 <- a * 1
adj50
```


### Nearest Neighbors Adjacency Matrix

Suppose we want to find the two nearest neighbors adjacency matrix.

```{r}
cols <- apply(D, 1, order)
D
cols

# we need to transpose the result
cols <- t(cols)
```

And then get columns 2 and 3 (why not column 1?)
```{r}
cols <- cols[, 2:3]
cols
```

As we now have the column numbers, we can make the row-column pairs that we want (`rowcols`). 

```{r}
rowcols <- cbind(rep(1:6, each=2), as.vector(t(cols)))
rowcols
```

We use these pairs as indices to change the values in matrix `Ak3`.
```{r}
Ak2 <- adj50 * 0
Ak2[rowcols] <- 1
Ak2
```

Is it symmetrical? Why (not)?

What is Ak2 * Ak2?
```{r}
Ak2.0 <- Ak2
diag(Ak2.0) <- 0

Ak2.0 %*% Ak2.0
```

Seems like someone should have made this into a function...
```{r}
p_load(spdep)

# make our points a spacial object
pts.sp <- SpatialPoints(pts)

Ak2.sp <- knearneigh(pts.sp, k = 2)
Ak2.sp
class(Ak2.sp)

Ak2.nb <- knn2nb(Ak2.sp)
Ak2.nb


Ak2.m <- nb2mat(Ak2.nb)
Ak2.m


Ak2.m %*% Ak2.m

```


#### Weights matrix

Getting the weights matrix is simple.
```{r}
W <- 1 / D
round(W, 4)
```

Row-normalization is not that difficult either. First get rid if the `Inf` values by changing them to `NA`. (Where did the `Inf` values come from?)

```{r}
W[!is.finite(W)] <- NA
```

Then compute the row sums.
```{r}
rtot <- rowSums(W, na.rm=TRUE)
# this is equivalent to
# rtot <- apply(W, 1, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
rtot
```

Divide the rows by their totals and check if they row sums add up to 1.
```{r}
W <- W / rtot
rowSums(W, na.rm=TRUE)
```

The values in the columns do not add up to 1.
```{r}
colSums(W, na.rm=TRUE)
```
