## Due: Thursday, February 13th at 8:30am

## Goals of this lab

1. Practice tidying code to adhere to the Tidyverse Style Guide.
1. Practice creating and refining graphs with `ggplot2`.
1. Consider the strengths and weaknesses of various `geom`s and `aes`thetics for telling a data story.

## Notes:

* When creating your graphs, consider context (i.e. axis labels, title, ...)!
* If I provide partially completed code, I will put `eval = FALSE` in the chunk.  Make sure to change that to `eval = TRUE` once you have completed the code in the chunk.
* Be prepared to ask for help from me, Simon, and your classmates!  We scratched the surface of `ggplot2` in class.  But I encourage you to really dig in and make your graphs your own (i.e. don't rely on defaults).



## Problems


### Problem 1: Decompose this graph!

Let's decompose another graph in the wild.  You can find the corresponding article [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article).

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/courses/math241s20/Labs/img/virus.png")
```

a. Identify the geom(s).

b. Identify the variables.

c. Explain how the variables are mapped to the geom(s).  When important, address the scale used.

d. What coordinate system is used?  

e. What additional context is provided?

f. What does this graph do well?

g. How could this graph be improved?

### Problem 2: Style This Code!

Take the following code and don't change its functionality but DO change its style.  Use the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)!

```{r}
thing.132232=data.frame(theanimalsweightisthisnumber=c(runif(3),NA),y=c("cat","mouse","dog","rat"))
median(thing.132232$theanimalsweightisthisnumber, TRUE);mean(thing.132232$theanimalsweightisthisnumber, 0 , TRUE); var(thing.132232$theanimalsweightisthisnumber, NULL, TRUE)


ggplot(thing.132232, aes(y=theanimalsweightisthisnumber,x=y))+geom_col()+scale_y_continuous()
```



### Problem 3: Imitation is the Sincerest Form of Flattery

For this problem, I want you to try to recreate a FiveThirtyEight.com graphic.  Awesomely, they share their data with the world [here](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/).  (Note: You don't need to recreate all their branding/background color scheme.)

a. Take a screenshot of the graph, upload it to the same folder on the server where you have saved your lab, and insert the file name below.  Then change the `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE`.


```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("filename.png")
```


b. Load the data and recreate the graph as best as you can.  

c. Now make the graph better somehow.

d. Justify why your rendition of this FiveThirtyEight.com graph is more effective at telling the data story than the original. 

### Problem 4: Visualizing Locations

We will cover mapping later in the course but we can still make simple graphs of spatial data.  For Problems 4 and 5, we will use data on car crashes in SE Portland in 2018. The data and a data manual (Crash_Code_Manual.pdf) can be found in the class's `Data` folder.  

```{r}
pdx_crash_2018 <- read_csv("/home/courses/math241s20/Data/pdx_crash_2018_page1.csv")
```

a. Create a scatterplot of longitude and latitude (`LONGTD_DD`, `LAT_DD`). Make sure we can get a sense of density of points from your plot.  Also map the variables to the correct axes.



b. Change the color of the points in your scatterplot to be your FAVORITE color.  Remember you can use `colors()` to find your favorite or you can find its hex code on the internet (e.g., https://www.colourlovers.com/).




c.  Create a heatmap.  Pick a color scale that is different from the default color scale.



d. Let's add some context.  Re-create your scatterplot or heatmap but this time point out where Reed is located.



e. Using your scatterplot and heatmap, reflect on the distribution of crashes.  Where are the accidents clumping?  Which plot gives us a better sense of where the crashes are occuring?  (I recommend you look at a map of SE Portland.)

f. Map another variable from the dataset to one of the aesthetics of the points in your plot.  What additional information does this provide?


### Problem 5: One Dataset, Visualized ~~25~~ 5 Ways

Inspired by Nathan Yau's [One Dataset, Visualized 25 Ways](https://flowingdata.com/2017/01/24/one-dataset-visualized-25-ways/), I want you to create 5 visualizations of the same data.  Make sure you have the data manual open for this problem!

a. Pick 3 - 4 variables you want to explore.  Provide their code names here.

b. Create 5 graphs.  A few things to consider:
    + Like Nathan's graphs, they don't all have to contain every one of your selected variables.
    + You can't use the same `geom` for all four graphs but you can use the same `geom` more than once.
    + Think carefully about color, the coordinate system, and scales.
    + Feel free to subset or wrangling the dataset if you want to but it isn't required.

c. Discuss the pros/cons of your graphs.  What useful information can be gleaned?  How do the different geoms and aesthetics impact the story?
